# Manipulation

Just another wrapper for robotics manipulation built on top of [MuJoCo](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco) and [MINK](https://github.com/kevinzakka/mink), featuring several grasping and manipulation scenarios. Supports motion planning via RRT and PRM implementations, as well as weld constraints with mocap targets.
